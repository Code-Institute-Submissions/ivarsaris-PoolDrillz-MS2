			<h1>About PoolDrillz</h1>
			<p>I started PoolDrillz as a project for all pool players. In my opinion, there is stucture missing when
				learning how to play pool.
				There is no clear path to becoming a better player. With PoolDrillz, I hope to make it easier for pool
				players of any level to find the right
				exercises and to create a community of players and trainers. If you have any suggestions, feedback,
				questions, or would like to collaborate with me,
				please e-mail me at ivarsaris@gmail.com</p>
